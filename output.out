is a compiler you specify it I expect your code looks like Foo NSObject NSMutableArray NSArray compiler confused between the declaration of the and the declaration of the Remember that properties and instance variables are different things in a property can be backed by an instance but really part of the public interface of a can work around this by changing your code to clearly separate the definition of the instance variable from the definition of the for example by prefixing the name of the instance Foo NSObject NSMutableArray NSArray objects way the compiler get confused about the property versus the instance variable in expressions like it but apparently to head off the inevitable Apple reserve the underbar prefix for instance reserved for if you dislike the feel free to use another

can read uevents from a NetLink It provides events about device daemon listening to the socket receives a packet of data each hotplug containing same information a usermode would receive in netlink packet contains a set null terminated text The line of the netlink packet the and separated by an line after the first contains pair defining a event current hotplug to add the to The kernel can also generate and probably want to monitor and Note that event does not give you either device node or the actual mount only sysfs If device nodes management and mounts management are handled by an external process have to find out the device node and a mount point yourself using major and minor device numbers and
to differing module names such forget to specify differing config directories if you build using vhost vhost I have not tried and there will likely be all sorts of library so be careful that both modules try and use the same Build into distinct directories as many of the dependencies as you It could get
JMS queue itself is sonicMQ but beside the this property is SonicMQ specific if not problem is that sometimes the JMS queue is full and the thread that tries to send messages to the queue is understanding of the Sonic MQ Performance Tuning Guide about the Property is that this is the normal total size of messages stored for a queue is the When a Queue tries to deliver a message to a queue that is at its maximum the sender will be controlled and the send of the message will be blocked until space is it would be possible to get a Notification with a JMX client but not sure this is feasible in your context a look at the SonicMQ Administrative Programming Guide if you want to dig this further or contact the But really not sure this would I know if what you want to do is a good
